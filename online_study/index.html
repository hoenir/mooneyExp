In the first part you will see a series of distorted images like the one below on the left. As you can see in the righthand image, the distorted images are derived from actual photographs. In what follows, you will <strong>briefly</strong> be presented with <strong>only</strong> the distorted image.</p> <div style='float: left; margin-right: 20px;'><img src='img/018tt.jpg' height='250' width='250'></img></div><div style='float: right; margin-left: 20px;'><img src='img/018gs.jpg' height='250' width='250'></img></div><p>Subsequently you will be asked a few questions about the image. For example, we ask you to make a guess on what is in the image. Note that it is OK to name just the basic level category, for example when you see a parrot in the image, 'parrot' will obviously be a correct answer but also correct is 'bird'. However, 'animal' will <strong>not</strong> be counted as a correct response. For the example above, 'rose' would be correct or 'flower', but not 'plant'. When soccer players are depicted, 'soccer', 'football', 'soccer players' will be correct, but not 'humans', 'outdoors', or 'sports'. You do not need to describe the image in full, just name the main object in it in one or two words. All images depict objects from one of the following broad level categories: animals, inanimate objects, plants, sports, vehicles, and food. Recognizing means knowing more than these broad labels for a given image. We always encourage you to make a guess if you can.</p><p>Two additional questions will be asked: one question on how confident you are that you know the solution and one question on how curious you are about the solution.</p><p> Next, the solution will be revealed to you.<p> Finally, you'll be asked to indicate how strong your <strong>aha-experience</strong> was. This describes the positive feeling of the 'click' you sometimes experience, when the pieces of the 'puzzle' fall together and you suddenly have 'insight' in the image.<p>Note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in what <strong>you</strong> see in the image and how <strong>you</strong> feel about it.</p><p>Press any key to start.</p></div>",
