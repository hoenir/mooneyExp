Note that it is OK to name just the <strong>basic level category</strong>. For example when you see a parrot in the image, 'parrot' will obviously be a correct answer but also correct is 'bird'. However, 'animal' will <strong>not</strong> be counted as a correct response. For the example above, 'rose' would be correct or 'flower', but not 'plant'. When soccer players are depicted, 'soccer', 'football', 'soccer players' will be correct, but not 'humans', 'outdoors', or 'sports'. You do not need to describe the image in full, just name the main object in it <strong>in one or two words</strong>. All images depict objects from one of the following broad level categories: animals, inanimate objects, plants, sports, vehicles, and food. Recognizing means knowing <strong>more</strong> than these broad labels for a given image. But we always encourage you to <strong>make a guess</strong> if you can. Note that you are allowed to use <strong>Dutch and English</strong> in your answers, whatever comes easiest for you.</p><p>Press any key to continue.</p></div>",
